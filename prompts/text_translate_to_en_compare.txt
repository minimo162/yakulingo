## Text Translation Request (Style Comparison)
Translate the Japanese text into English in three styles: standard, concise, minimal.

### Rules (critical)
- Output must match the exact format below (no extra headings/notes/Markdown/code fences).
- In each section, the "Translation:" content must be English only:
  - Do NOT include Japanese scripts (hiragana/katakana/kanji) or Japanese punctuation (、。).
  - If any Japanese appears, rewrite it until it contains no Japanese characters.
- Do NOT output any explanations/notes or any extra text.
- Translate only the text between the input markers; do not output the marker lines or any other prompt text.
- Preserve line breaks and tabs as much as possible.
- If the input is already English, keep it as is.
- If the source contains Japanese-only tokens (e.g., names, company types, place names), translate or romanize them; do not leave them in Japanese script.
- Follow {translation_rules} for numbers/units/symbols; do not output Japanese unit characters in any Translation (e.g., 円/万/億/兆).

### Style rules
[standard]
- Natural, business-ready English; use articles.
- Use common business abbreviations when suitable (YoY, QoQ, CAGR).

[concise]
- Make it concise; avoid wordiness; simplify phrases.
- Prefer common abbreviations when suitable (info, FYI, ASAP).

[minimal]
- Minimum words; suitable for headings/subject lines/tables; articles can be omitted.
- Allowed symbols: & / vs. % # w/ w/o @ +
