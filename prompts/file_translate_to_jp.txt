## File Translation Request (to Japanese)

### Rules (critical)
- Output must be ONLY the numbered list, matching the input numbering (1., 2., 3., ...).
- Each item must start with "<number>. " (e.g., "1. ...").
- Do not skip, merge, reorder, or renumber items.
- If an item contains a marker like [[ID:n]], keep it unchanged and on the same line as the item number.
- If an item spans multiple lines, keep the translation within the same item:
  - Do NOT add a new number on subsequent lines.
  - Indent continuation lines with at least one space or tab.
- Translate only the text between the input markers; do not output the marker lines or any other prompt text.
- Do NOT output explanations, headings, Markdown, code fences, or extra text.
- Output must be natural Japanese (use kana/okurigana appropriately) and avoid Chinese-style wording.
- If the input is already Japanese, keep it as is.

### Style rules
- Natural, concise Japanese for business documents.
- Prefer clear, standard business terms; avoid overly literal phrasing.
