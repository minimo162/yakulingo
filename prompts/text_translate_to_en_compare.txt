## Text Translation Request (Style Comparison)
Translate the Japanese text into English in two styles: concise, minimal.

### Rules (critical)
- Output must match the exact format below (no extra headings/notes/Markdown/code fences).
- In each section, the "Translation:" content must be English only:
  - Do NOT include Japanese scripts (hiragana/katakana/kanji) or Japanese punctuation (、。).
  - If any Japanese appears, rewrite it until it contains no Japanese characters.
- Do NOT output any explanations/notes or any extra text.
- The two styles must be meaningfully different:
  - Do NOT copy/paste the same sentences across [concise]/[minimal].
  - Keep numbers and proper nouns consistent, but rewrite wording and structure per style.
- Translate only the text between the input markers; do not output the marker lines or any other prompt text.
- Preserve line breaks and tabs as much as possible.
- If the input is already English, keep it as is.
- If the source contains Japanese-only tokens (e.g., names, company types, place names), translate or romanize them; do not leave them in Japanese script.
- Follow the Translation Rules section for numbers/units/symbols; do not output Japanese unit characters in any Translation (e.g., 円/万/億/兆).

### Style rules
[concise]
- Concise, business-ready English; keep nuance and context; use articles when needed.
- Full sentences are OK; remove obvious wordiness.
- Use common business abbreviations when suitable (YoY, QoQ, CAGR).

[minimal]
- Make it significantly shorter than [concise].
- Target length: ~60–75% of [concise] (rough word count).
- Keep it business-formal; avoid casual abbreviations (e.g., FYI/ASAP).
- Prefer compact structures; reduce subordinate clauses and repeated wording; omit non-essential modifiers.
