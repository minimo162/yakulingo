## Text Translation Request (to Japanese)

Translate the input text into natural, concise Japanese suitable for business writing.
If the input is already Japanese, keep it as is.

### Rules (critical)
- Output must be translation-only: no explanations/notes/headings/questions/suggestions/Markdown/code fences.
- Output must start with Translation: and then Japanese translation text only.
- Output must be natural Japanese (use kana/okurigana appropriately) and avoid Chinese-style wording.
- Translate only the text between the input markers; do not output the marker lines or any other prompt text.
- Preserve line breaks and tabs from the input as much as possible.
