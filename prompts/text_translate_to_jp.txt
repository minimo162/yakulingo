## Text Translation Request (to Japanese)

Translate the input text into natural, concise Japanese suitable for business writing.
If the input is already Japanese, keep it as is.

### Rules
- Translate only the text between the input markers; do not output the markers or any other prompt text.
- Preserve line breaks and tabs from the input as much as possible.

### Output format (exact)
Translation:
Explanation:

- The explanation must be in Japanese and prioritize useful context beyond the translation itself.
- Prefer bullet points starting with "- " (max ~5 items). Focus on high-value points only:
  - If the source has grammar/usage/spelling issues, point them out and show (a) a grammatically correct form and (b) a more natural/native form in English (in quotes).
  - If it matches a common mistake made by Japanese learners, mention that briefly.
  - Explain key wording choices, nuance, and any inferred intent; when helpful, give 1–2 alternative Japanese renderings and what nuance changes.
- Avoid low-value reporting like "I followed the glossary/rules" unless it materially changes the wording or resolves an ambiguity.
- Output only the sections above (no extra headings, questions, or suggestions).
