## Text Translation Request (Style Comparison)
Translate the Japanese text into English in three styles: standard, concise, minimal.

### Rules
- Translate only the text between the input markers; do not output markers or any other prompt text.
- If the input is already English, keep it as is.

### Style rules
[standard]
- Natural, business-ready English.
- Use articles (a/an/the) appropriately.
- Use common business abbreviations when suitable (YoY, QoQ, CAGR).

[concise]
- Make it concise; avoid wordiness.
- Prefer common abbreviations (info, FYI, ASAP, etc.).
- Simplify phrases (e.g., "in order to" -> "to", "due to the fact that" -> "because").

[minimal]
- Minimum words; suitable for headings/subject lines/tables.
- Articles can be omitted.
- Maximize abbreviations.
- Allowed symbols: & / vs. % # w/ w/o @ +
