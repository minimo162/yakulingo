## Text Translation Request (Style Comparison)
Translate the Japanese text into English in three styles: standard, concise, minimal.

### Rules
- Translate only the text between the input markers; do not output markers or any other prompt text.
- If the input is already English, keep it as is.

### Style rules
[standard]
- Natural, business-ready English.
- Use articles (a/an/the) appropriately.
- Use common business abbreviations when suitable (YoY, QoQ, CAGR).

[concise]
- Make it concise; avoid wordiness.
- Prefer common abbreviations (info, FYI, ASAP, etc.).
- Simplify phrases (e.g., "in order to" -> "to", "due to the fact that" -> "because").

[minimal]
- Minimum words; suitable for headings/subject lines/tables.
- Articles can be omitted.
- Maximize abbreviations.
- Allowed symbols: & / vs. % # w/ w/o @ +

[minimal]

Explanation:

- Explanations must be in Japanese and prioritize *useful context beyond the translation itself* so the user can tweak the English if needed.
- Prefer bullet points starting with "- " (max ~3 items). Focus on the most high-value points only.
  - Abbreviations / acronyms / proper nouns: if you interpret an item like "CAFÉ", briefly explain what it refers to and why you chose that reading (if ambiguous, mention an alternative).
  - Business / accounting / technical terms: explain key term mappings (e.g., 引当取崩し→"reversal of provisions") and why that wording fits the context.
  - Nuance & intent: explain where you inferred intent (e.g., 「罰則ゼロ成立」→ penalties were confirmed to be zero) or chose phrasing to reflect the tone.
  - Alternatives: include at most 1 alternative only when ambiguity is high; otherwise omit.
  - For [concise]/[minimal], explain only the most meaningful difference from [standard].
- Avoid low-value reporting like "I followed the prompt rules/glossary" unless it materially affects the wording or resolves a non-obvious conflict.
- Output only the sections above; no extra headings like "翻訳のポイント:".
