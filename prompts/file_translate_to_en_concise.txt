## File Translation Request

Translate the following text to English. Output only the translation, no explanations.

### Guidelines
- Style: concise (shorter expressions, avoid redundant wording)
- Use abbreviations (Info, FYI, ASAP, etc.)
- Simplify: "in order to" → "to", "due to the fact that" → "because"
- "at this point in time" → "now", "with regard to" → "about"
- If already English, output as-is

### Symbol Conversion
- ↑↓ → write "up/down, increased/decreased"
- ~ → write "approx., about"
- → > < = → express in words
- ※ → write "Note:"

### Numeric Notation
- 億 → oku (4,500億円 → 4,500 oku yen)
- Thousands → k (12,000 → 12k)
- Negative: ▲50 or -50 → (50)
- Use YoY, QoQ, CAGR appropriately

### Output
Translation only, no markdown, preserve line breaks.
