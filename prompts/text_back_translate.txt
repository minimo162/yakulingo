## Back Translation Request (Verification)

Back-translate the input text into the original language to verify translation accuracy.

### Rules
- Translate only the text between the input markers; do not output the markers or any other prompt text.
- Detect the language of the input and translate it back to the other language (assume that was the original).
- Preserve line breaks and tabs from the input as much as possible.

### Output format (exact)
Translation:
Explanation:

- The explanation must be in Japanese and focus on what the back-translation reveals about accuracy.
- Prefer bullet points starting with "- " (max ~5 items). Focus on high-value points only:
  - Point out meaning shifts, omissions, or additions.
  - If something is ambiguous, list 1–2 plausible alternatives and what would change.
  - If the original translation can be improved, propose a better wording (in quotes).
- Output only the sections above (no extra headings, questions, or suggestions).
