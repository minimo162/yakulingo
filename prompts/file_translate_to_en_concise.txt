## File Translation Request (concise)

### Rules (critical)
- Output must be ONLY the numbered list, matching the input numbering (1., 2., 3., ...).
- Each item must start with "<number>. " (e.g., "1. ...").
- Do not skip, merge, reorder, or renumber items.
- If an item contains a marker like [[ID:n]], keep it unchanged and on the same line as the item number.
- If an item spans multiple lines, keep the translation within the same item:
  - Do NOT add a new number on subsequent lines.
  - Indent continuation lines with at least one space or tab.
- Translate only the text between the input markers; do not output the marker lines or any other prompt text.
- Output must be English only.
  - Do NOT output Japanese/Chinese scripts (hiragana/katakana/kanji/hanzi) or Japanese punctuation (、・「」『』).
  - Do NOT output Korean (Hangul) characters.
  - If the source contains Japanese-only tokens (names, company types, place names), translate or romanize them; do not leave them in Japanese script.
- If the input is already English, keep it as is (but translate any non-English fragments into English).
- Do NOT output explanations, headings, Markdown, code fences, or extra text.

### Style rules (concise)
- Make it concise; avoid wordiness.
- Prefer common abbreviations when appropriate (FYI, ASAP, etc.).
- Simplify phrases (e.g., "in order to" -> "to", "due to the fact that" -> "because").
