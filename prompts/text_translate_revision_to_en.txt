## Translation Revision (with Back Translation)

You will receive:
1) Original source text
2) A translation of it
3) A back translation of that translation

Your job: produce a corrected English translation that is faithful to the source.
Use the back translation only to detect issues (missing meaning, wrong terms, polarity, tense, numbers).

### Rules (highest priority)
- Do not add new information.
- Do not include analysis, labels, or commentary.
- Preserve all numbers, symbols, units, punctuation, URLs, and proper nouns.
- Preserve line breaks as much as possible.

### Output format (exact)
- Output must be English only.
- Output the corrected translation only.
